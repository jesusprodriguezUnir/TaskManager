# study-dashboard

A self-hostable personal study dashboard. Track your **courses, schedule, lectures, study topics, deliverables, and tasks** in one place — and let **Claude** use the app from your browser, phone, or Claude Code.

### Demo — Claude reading a lecture PDF from the app over MCP

![Claude reading a lecture PDF over MCP](docs/demo-mcp.gif)

Claude calls `list_course_files` to locate the PDF in the app's file store, then `read_course_file` — which renders each page to a PNG and streams it back as vision input. Claude answers questions about the lecture without you uploading anything.

## What makes it different

The MCP server ships with **~45 tools — anything you can do in the UI, Claude can do too**. Create a study topic, mark something studied, upload a file, render a PDF as images, whatever.

Plug it into Claude.ai as a custom connector (full OAuth 2.1) and those tools are live in **Claude Code on your laptop, claude.ai in your browser, and the Claude iOS app on your phone**. Open Claude anywhere and it has the same view of your coursework that you do.

## You'll need

Before you start, have:

- A **Supabase account** (free tier is fine) — database + file storage
- A **Vercel account** (free hobby tier is fine) — hosts the app at a public URL so Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app can reach the MCP endpoint. Any other Python-capable host (Fly, Railway, your own VPS) works if you prefer; `vercel.json` is pre-configured for Vercel.
- **Node 20+** and **pnpm** (via [corepack](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack))
- **Python 3.12** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **~15 minutes** for first-time setup

If you only ever want to use the dashboard locally from your laptop — no Claude.ai, no phone — you can skip Vercel and run it on `localhost`.

## Quick start

Get the app running on your laptop against a free Supabase project. No deploy, no MCP yet — that comes after.

**1. Clone + install deps.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmmarSaleh50/study-dashboard
cd study-dashboard
uv sync                              # Python deps
cd web && pnpm install && cd ..      # frontend deps
```

**2. Create a Supabase project.** Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → **New project**. From **Settings → API** grab your **Project URL** and the **`service_role` secret** — you'll paste both in the next step.

**3. Fill in `.env`.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
uv run python -m app.tools.hashpw 'pick-a-strong-password'     # → APP_PASSWORD_HASH
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))'   # → SESSION_SECRET
```

Open `.env`, paste the Supabase URL, the service key, the password hash, and the session secret. Create `web/.env.local` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`.

**4. Apply the migrations.** In Supabase → **SQL Editor**, paste and run each file under `db/migrations/` in order (`0001_init.sql` → `0002_lectures.sql` → `0003_oauth.sql` → `0004_app_settings.sql`).

**5. Run it.**

```bash
# Terminal 1
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload        # → http://localhost:8000

# Terminal 2
cd web && pnpm dev                          # → http://localhost:5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and log in with the password you hashed. That's it — you're running.

Stuck? Full walkthrough with screenshots-of-setup-steps, Supabase CLI alternative, and troubleshooting is in **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)**.

## What you do inside the app

On first boot, everything's empty. You build it up in the UI (or via Claude through the MCP connector):

1. **Settings → Profile**: name, monogram, institution
2. **Settings → Semester**: label (e.g. "Fall 2026"), start/end dates, timezone, locale
3. **Courses → +**: create each course with a short code (ASB, CS101…), a full name, and an accent color
4. **Course detail**: add schedule slots (weekday / time / room), upcoming deliverables, and the study topics you're expected to cover
5. **Dashboard**: lives here. Greeting, *falling-behind* banner, metric tiles, weekly grid, course cards, deadlines + tasks.

## The MCP connector

> **Prerequisite: the app needs to be reachable at a public URL.** Claude.ai and the iOS app can't talk to `localhost` — so before connecting the MCP, deploy to Vercel (or Fly / Railway / your own VPS). Full steps in [INSTALL.md §6](./INSTALL.md#6-deploy-to-vercel-or-skip). Claude Code is the exception: it can hit `http://localhost:8000/mcp` directly.

Once the app is live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`, it serves a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, OAuth-gated. One endpoint, every client:

```bash
# Claude.ai (browser + iOS app): Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector
#   paste: https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp

# Claude Code (local CLI, any directory):
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user \
  study-dashboard https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp
```

Both flows open your dashboard's login in a browser for the one-time OAuth consent. After that, the same ~45 tools are live wherever you use Claude:

- *"list my courses"* / *"what's due this week?"* / *"what did we cover in RN last week?"*
- *"we just finished VL 3 of ASB, we covered topics X, Y, Z — create the lecture and topics"* → Claude calls `create_lecture` + `add_lecture_topics`
- *"mark chapter §1.4 as studied"* → `list_study_topics` + `mark_studied`
- *"open the ASB lecture 2 slides and tell me what §0.1.3 is about"* → `list_course_files` + `read_course_file` (PDFs are rendered to PNGs and streamed back as vision — Claude literally sees the slides)
- *"I'm falling behind in AML, help me prioritise"* → `get_fall_behind` + plan

**Claude.ai Projects** get a bigger quality boost when you paste a tailored system prompt alongside the connector. Template: [`docs/claude-ai-system-prompt.md`](./docs/claude-ai-system-prompt.md).

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres
- **MCP:** Python `mcp` SDK, mounted at `/mcp` over Streamable HTTP with OAuth 2.1
- **Hosting:** Vercel (one project hosts both the static frontend and the Python functions)

## Design

The visual design was prototyped in [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design). The brief that produced it — plus a reusable template for writing your own briefs — is at [`docs/claude-design-brief.md`](./docs/claude-design-brief.md).
The one that i used to transform the UI is at (If you are coming from the reddit post) [`docs/examples/design-brief-example.md`](./docs/examples/design-brief-example.md).

## Heads up

This started as a personal project for a German university, so **don't be surprised if you spot hardcoded German strings** here and there — slot kinds (`Vorlesung`, `Übung`, `Tutorium`, `Praktikum`), the odd UI label, sample data. PRs to genericize or i18n any of it are very welcome.

## License

MIT — do whatever you like. Credit / a star / a link back is appreciated but not required.

## Contributing

**Yes, please.** If you self-host this and something breaks, something feels off, or you wish it did one more thing — open an issue or a PR. No ceremony. Typo fixes, a clearer sentence in INSTALL.md, a new MCP tool you wrote for your own use, a CSS tweak that makes the mobile layout less cramped — all welcome.

If you're unsure whether a bigger change is in scope, a quick *"would you take a PR that does X?"* issue is the easy way to find out.
