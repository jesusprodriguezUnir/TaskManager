### Demo — Claude reading a lecture PDF from the app over MCP

![Claude reading a lecture PDF over MCP](docs/demo-mcp.gif)

Claude calls `list_course_files` to locate the PDF in the app's file store, then `read_course_file` — which renders each page to a PNG and streams it back as vision input. Claude answers questions about the lecture without you uploading anything.

## How I use this

### The one-time seed

Before any of the day-to-day stuff, I had to get a semester's worth of courses, schedules, exam rules, and lecture material into the app. I didn't want to do that by hand and I didn't want to write a bespoke import script, so I let Claude Code do it:

1. **Pulled everything off my university's LMS *(Moodle, in my case)* into a local folder.** For each course I downloaded the syllabus, schedule, the professor's organizational slides, existing exercise sheets *(Übungsblätter)*, and the official module catalogue *(Modulhandbuch)*. Structure on disk:

   ```
   Semester 4/
     semester.md              # one-liner per course, semester dates, links
     schedule.md              # weekly schedule (my source of truth)
     module-catalogue.pdf     # (Modulhandbuch)
     ASB/
       course.md              # structured source-of-truth (see below)
       00_introduction.pdf    # prof's org slides
       exercise-sheets/       # (Übungsblätter)
     Computer-Architecture/   # (Rechnerarchitektur)
       course.md
       1 Intro und History.pdf
       ...
     ...
   ```

2. **Had Claude Code build one `course.md` per course.** It read every PDF, the LMS *(Moodle)* copy, and the module catalogue entry, and produced a normalized markdown with a `Meta` table (official name, module code, ECTS, professor, language, exam format, retries, weight), the weekly schedule in the prof's own words, and any grading rules / attendance requirements (e.g. "lab attendance *(Praktikum)* ≥ 75 % for exam admission"). That file became the course's source of truth — everything else downstream pulls from it.

3. **Seeded the dashboard via the MCP connector.** With Claude Code pointed at the running dashboard over MCP, I asked it to walk through each `course.md` and:
   - `create_course` with the meta (code, full name, color, ECTS, professor, language, and a `folder_name` matching the local folder — so the course-detail **Files** tab scopes to the right prefix in the bucket)
   - `upsert_schedule_slot` for every recurring slot in `schedule.md` (lecture / tutorial / lab / seminar — or in German: Vorlesung / Übung / Tutorium / Praktikum)
   - `update_klausur` with the exam format + retries
   - `create_deliverable` for every known exercise sheet / project deadline in the semester
   - upload every PDF from each course folder into the `course_files` bucket (so `read_course_file` can hand them to Claude as vision later)

   > If you don't want to keep a local `Semester 4/` folder at all, every PDF upload can also happen from inside the app — drag-and-drop into the **Files** view. The local folder is just what works for me because I'm already downloading the files anyway.

4. **Opened the dashboard → everything was there.** Weekly grid populated, four courses with accents, exam info per course, every exercise sheet showing up in the deadlines list.

**From then on it's incremental.** New lectures land on the LMS *(Moodle)*, I either drop the PDFs into the corresponding `Semester 4/<course>/` folder on my laptop (Claude Code picks them up and uploads) or drag-and-drop them straight into the app's **Files** view. If the `course.md` needs an update (new grading rule announced, exam date confirmed, topic added), Claude edits the markdown *and* pushes the change through the MCP (`update_course`, `update_klausur`, etc.) so the dashboard and the source-of-truth stay aligned.

### A typical week

**Right after a lecture.** Walking out of class, I open Claude on my phone: *"We just finished VL 4 of ASB, covered pumping lemma, closure properties, and non-regularity of aⁿbⁿ."* Claude creates the lecture #4, adds the study topics with proper descriptions linked to lecture #4, marks it attended. couple of seconds. The dashboard is caught up.

**Later that day, I drop the slides in.** I upload the slides of the lecture to the app. Claude can now fetch and read the slides on demand (Through the MCP) and use them to teach me. (it can also fetch only the pages of the slides it needs to teach me, so it doesn't have to read the whole PDF).

**Evening, sitting down to actually study.** *"Am I falling behind in anything?"* Claude pulls the fall-behind list — *"3 ASB topics unstudied, next lecture in 7h."* I pick the first one:

> *"Walk me through pumping lemma §2.4. Pull the ASB VL4 slides and use the actual definition and example from there. Ask me a check question halfway through."*

Claude calls `list_study_topics` to find the topic row, `list_course_files` + `read_course_file` to fetch the slides (pages rendered to PNGs — Claude literally sees them, not OCR text), then teaches from the prof's slide wording. When it hits the check question I answer, it either corrects me or moves on. When I confirm I've got it: *"mark §2.4 studied,"* and Claude calls `mark_studied`.

Then the next topic. Same loop. The "3 unstudied" count on the dashboard ticks down in real time.

**Before bed, planning tomorrow.** *"What's due this week?"* One list, sorted by due date. *"Add a task: finish ASB Blatt 3 by Monday 16:00, high priority."* Done.

**On the dashboard itself.** Everything Claude did — the lecture, the topics, the mark-studied, the task — is already there when I open the UI. The *falling-behind* banner only fires when I have unstudied topics and the next lecture on them is close. The weekly grid shows what's coming. Course cards show per-course progress. I don't have to tell the dashboard what I did because Claude already did.

The dashboard is where I see things. Claude is how I edit them. Same database behind both. (You can also use the dashboard UI to edit things, of course, It does have CRUD operations for everything).

## What makes it different

The MCP server ships with **~45 tools — anything you can do in the UI, Claude can do too**. Create a study topic, mark something studied, upload a file, render a PDF as images, whatever.

Plug it into Claude.ai as a custom connector (full OAuth 2.1) and those tools are live in **Claude Code on your laptop, claude.ai in your browser, and the Claude iOS app on your phone**. Open Claude anywhere and it has the same view of your coursework that you do.

## You'll need

Before you start, have:

- A **Supabase account** (free tier is fine) — database + file storage
- A **Vercel account** (free hobby tier is fine) — hosts the app at a public URL so Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app can reach the MCP endpoint. Any other Python-capable host (Fly, Railway, your own VPS) works if you prefer; `vercel.json` is pre-configured for Vercel.
- **Node 20+** and **pnpm** (via [corepack](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack))
- **Python 3.12** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **~15 minutes** for first-time setup

If you only ever want to use the dashboard locally from your laptop — no Claude.ai, no phone — you can skip Vercel and run it on `localhost`.

## Quick start

Get the app running on your laptop against a free Supabase project. No deploy, no MCP yet — that comes after.

**1. Clone + install deps.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmmarSaleh50/study-dashboard
cd study-dashboard
uv sync                              # Python deps
cd web && pnpm install && cd ..      # frontend deps
```

**2. Create a Supabase project.** Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → **New project**. Set a database password and save it somewhere secure (you can't retrieve it later). Once it provisions: copy the **Project URL** from the project overview (top of the page → **Copy** → *Project URL*), and grab the **`service_role` key** from **Project Settings → API Keys → "Legacy anon, service_role API keys"**. You'll paste both in the next step.

**3. Fill in `.env`.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
uv run python -m app.tools.hashpw 'pick-a-strong-password'     # → APP_PASSWORD_HASH
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))'   # → SESSION_SECRET  (use `py` on Windows if `python` isn't on PATH)
```

Open `.env`, paste the Supabase URL, the service key, the password hash, and the session secret. Create `web/.env.local` with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`.

**4. Apply the migrations.** In Supabase → **SQL Editor**, paste and run each file under `db/migrations/` in order (`0001_init.sql` → `0002_lectures.sql` → `0003_oauth.sql` → `0004_app_settings.sql`).

**5. Run it.**

```bash
# Terminal 1
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload        # → http://localhost:8000

# Terminal 2
cd web && pnpm dev                          # → http://localhost:5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and log in with the password you hashed. That's it — you're running.

Stuck? Full walkthrough with screenshots-of-setup-steps, Supabase CLI alternative, and troubleshooting is in **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)**.

## What you do inside the app

On first boot, everything's empty. You build it up in the UI (or via Claude through the MCP connector):

1. **Settings → Profile**: name, monogram, institution
2. **Settings → Semester**: label (e.g. "Fall 2026"), start/end dates, timezone, locale
3. **Courses → +**: create each course with a short code (ASB, CS101…), a full name, and an accent color
4. **Course detail**: add schedule slots (weekday / time / room), upcoming deliverables, and the study topics you're expected to cover
5. **Dashboard**: lives here. Greeting, *falling-behind* banner, metric tiles, weekly grid, course cards, deadlines + tasks.

## The MCP connector

> **Prerequisite: the app needs to be reachable at a public URL.** Claude.ai and the iOS app can't talk to `localhost` — so before connecting the MCP, deploy to Vercel (or Fly / Railway / your own VPS). Full steps in [INSTALL.md §6](./INSTALL.md#6-deploy-to-vercel-or-skip). Claude Code is the exception: it can hit `http://localhost:8000/mcp` directly.

Once the app is live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`, it serves a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, OAuth-gated. One endpoint, every client:

```bash
# Claude.ai (browser + iOS app): Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector
#   paste: https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp

# Claude Code (local CLI, any directory):
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user \
  study-dashboard https://your-project.vercel.app/mcp
```

Both flows open your dashboard's login in a browser for the one-time OAuth consent. After that, the same ~45 tools are live wherever you use Claude:

- *"list my courses"* / *"what's due this week?"* / *"what did we cover in RN last week?"*
- *"we just finished VL 3 of ASB, we covered topics X, Y, Z — create the lecture and topics"* → Claude calls `create_lecture` + `add_lecture_topics`
- *"mark chapter §1.4 as studied"* → `list_study_topics` + `mark_studied`
- *"open the ASB lecture 2 slides and tell me what §0.1.3 is about"* → `list_course_files` + `read_course_file` (PDFs are rendered to PNGs and streamed back as vision — Claude literally sees the slides)
- *"I'm falling behind in AML, help me prioritise"* → `get_fall_behind` + plan

**Claude.ai Projects** get a bigger quality boost when you paste a tailored system prompt alongside the connector. Template: [`docs/claude-ai-system-prompt.md`](./docs/claude-ai-system-prompt.md).

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres
- **MCP:** Python `mcp` SDK, mounted at `/mcp` over Streamable HTTP with OAuth 2.1
- **Hosting:** Vercel (one project hosts both the static frontend and the Python functions)

## Design

The visual design was prototyped in [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design). The brief that produced it — plus a reusable template for writing your own briefs — is at [`docs/claude-design-brief.md`](./docs/claude-design-brief.md).
The one that i used to transform the UI is at (If you are coming from the reddit post) [`docs/examples/design-brief-example.md`](./docs/examples/design-brief-example.md).

## Heads up

This started as a personal project for a German university, so **don't be surprised if you spot hardcoded German strings** here and there — slot kinds (`Vorlesung`, `Übung`, `Tutorium`, `Praktikum`), the odd UI label, sample data. PRs to genericize or i18n any of it are very welcome.

## License

MIT — do whatever you like. Credit / a star / a link back is appreciated but not required.

## Contributing

**Yes, please.** If you self-host this and something breaks, something feels off, or you wish it did one more thing — open an issue or a PR. No ceremony. Typo fixes, a clearer sentence in INSTALL.md, a new MCP tool you wrote for your own use, a CSS tweak that makes the mobile layout less cramped — all welcome.

If you're unsure whether a bigger change is in scope, a quick *"would you take a PR that does X?"* issue is the easy way to find out.
