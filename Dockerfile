# `--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips '*'` makes uvicorn honor
# X-Forwarded-Proto / X-Forwarded-For from the upstream reverse proxy.
# Without this, redirects (e.g. /mcp → /mcp/) come back with `http://`
# scheme instead of `https://`, and any client following them with a
# bearer token (Claude.ai's MCP connector being the painful one) drops
# the token on the downgrade and the request fails. The wildcard is
# safe because openstudy is only reachable from the docker bridge — the
# frontend container Caddy is the only thing that sets these headers.
